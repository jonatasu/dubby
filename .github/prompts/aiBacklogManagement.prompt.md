# Backlog Management (`copilot-todo.md`)

Rules:

- Parse user intent on each request; map to existing tasks or propose new ones.
- Before editing the backlog, present a diff summary and wait for approval.
- Keep IDs sequential and statuses explicit (not-started/in-progress/completed).
- Definition of Ready: clear outcome, acceptance criteria, dependencies, risks.
