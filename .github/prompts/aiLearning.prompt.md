# Learning & Development (Context)

When exploring new libraries or improvements:

- Prefer well-documented, stable libs with wheels for macOS/Linux (avoid heavy compiles in CI).
- Consider performance and CPU-only viability for TTS/ASR choices.
- Keep notes on trade-offs and link benchmarks if measured.

Reference Files:

- requirements.txt
- README.md
